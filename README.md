Requirements:
EditorCore with Super Mario Odyssey plugin & Blender 3.6 (Tested on 3.6 and 4.2, DOES NOT WORK ON 4.0+!)

This tutorial assumes that you already have EditorCore installed and set up. If not, get it here: 
https://github.com/exelix11/EditorCore
and the Odyssey plugin here:
https://github.com/exelix11/OdysseyEditor

Instructions:

1. Install OdysseyImportComplete.py from the Releases tab

2. Install the Blender plugin: In blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Install, go through the file system and select OdysseyImporterDAE.py, then click Install Addon

3. Setting up the Blender plugin: Press the small arrow on the left of the SMO Level Importer tab in Preferences, a window will drop down. In the DAE Folder field,
press on the folder icon on the right of it, then navigate to the Custom folder once viewing the folder with all of the .daes,
press Accept. (EditorCore are no longer using to import .obj models in the OdysseyModels folder. The models are broken with no rig.)

( Optional settings: "Exclude Objects", you can type in the name of objects to exclude them from  being imported, it is recommended that you add Mesh1_Model for an exclusion. 
"Enable Debug Logging", Enables advanced debugging, ! THIS WILL SLOW THINGS DOWN ! )

Mandatory Option: Scenario Number, Selects one of the 14 scenarios for a level.

4. Obtaining XML for level: In OdysseyEditor (EditorCore) Open a stage of choice. once open, press Level files > XXXXXX.byml. (The byml that you should choose will
look like this: ForestWorldHomeStageMap and not this: ForestWorldHomeStage_7_x_02.byml), Make sure to choose the right one.
Now, click on the correct .byml, and it will open a small window. You'll see a lot of +dictionary stuff. Right click on the white space next to it, then press "Export as XML"
Save it to somewhere easily accessible for Blender, name it what you'd like.

5. Finally back in Blender, press File > Import > Import SMO Level XML, this will open a file browser window, navigate to the .xml file you saved, click on it, then press
Import. Blender will be frozen temporarily, time varies on how big the stage is. It will probably be massive, so scale it to .025.
Then press View > Frame Selected

Enjoy ripping levels from Super Mario Odyssey.

Notice:

1. OdysseyEditor (EditorCore) don't use that anymore to select OdysseyModels folder.

2. OBJ are no longer supported. But DAE are supported
